## **Problem Statement**

During lockdown, students faced a lot of problem arranging books. So, they had to turn towards online material which included ebooks. Finding eBooks links lead to many scams/viruses/spam mails from different sites. Buying books from online sites is risky, tends to many frauds and it is not recommended.

## **Solution**

Using Google books API we have designed an app that opens desired books by the student by using a simple search mechanism. By using this method we are protected from any kind of scam/virus and the user is protected as Google books API is a trusted source for all ebooks. It has a wide library of of books which are included in syllabus. Nowadays it also has the option of audio books which will help students study from home. This will lead to saving of paper and other resources used to print books.
